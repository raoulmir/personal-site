   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>I'm a professional and, experienced full-stack software engineer. 
   I began my journey with nothing but BTEC course in IT and some personal learning in the web space, starting as a Junior Web Developer and, within a matter of 4 years reaching seniour level.
   Through this journey I've seen a lot; a company slowly moving away from a very dated waterfall style development process, beginnign to integrate proper CD/CI and becoming Agile (through which I learned a lot myself)
   and I've been involved with many different parts of the company, working on a variety of public facing and enterprise websites and web applications. Even the stack and approach on these were widely varied; 
   I've had meaningful exposure to all sorts, from legacy websites running PHP 5.6 with jQuery on the front-end, to full MVC Laravel applications, extensive web APIs, and more modern Javascript single-page applications with Vue.js and Nuxt.js. At one point I've even had to build some web/mobile hybrid apps.
   <p>Majority of my expertise these days are in API development and modern front end applications build using Vue/Nuxt, but I've proven to be quite versetile and adaptible in my skills.</p>
   <p>I'm now also at a stage where I provide support to newer and, junior software engineers, either through direct guidance or a pull request process. 
   I've been told in many scenarious I'm a great person to work and communicate with and I've managed to exapnd my "people" skills more than I would've imagined in a programming career. I've even been a Scrum Master</p>
   <p>As a person, I find myself enjoying hoping from on thing to another. I simply love trying new things and hobbies, and some stick around, while others go back on the shelf to gather dust until I'm interested again.
   I love coding, playing and experimenting with tech, taking photos on my travels and editing them, as well as more passive hobbies such as movies, books and videogames. 
   For other forms of recration, I also enjoy going to venues and music festivals and I won't shy away from a pint or two. </p>
